Definitions:
- Act of throwing: See throwing motion.
- Affect the play: A breach or call affects the play if it is reasonable to assume that the outcome of the specific play may have been meaningfully different had the breach or call not occurred.
- Attacking end zone: The end zone in which the team in question is currently attempting to score.
- Best perspective: The most complete viewpoint available by a player that includes the relative position of the disc, ground, players and line markers involved in the play.
- Call: A clearly communicated statement that a foul, infraction, violation, turnover or injury has occurred. The following terms may be used: Foul, Travel, specific name of Marking Infraction, Violation (or specific name of Violation), specific name of turnovers, Technical, and Injury.
- Catch: A non-spinning disc trapped between at least two body parts. If a player initially catches a pass and then, prior to establishing possession, they do not maintain the catch (‘maintain the catch’ means to continue to have a non-spinning disc trapped between at least two body parts), that initial catch is deemed to have ended.
- Central zone: The area of the playing field including the goal lines but excluding the end zones and the perimeter lines.
- Defending end zone: The end zone in which the team in question is currently attempting to prevent the opposition from scoring.
- Defensive player: Any player whose team is not in possession of the disc.
- End zone: One of the two areas at the end of the playing field where teams can score a goal by catching the disc there.
- Goal line The line separating the central zone from each end zone. It is not part of the end zone
- Ground The ground consists of all substantial solid objects, including grass, marker cones, equipment, water, trees, fences, walls and non-players, but excluding all players and their worn clothing, airborne particles and precipitation.
- Ground contact Refers to all player contact with the ground directly related to a specific event or manoeuvre, including landing or recovery after being off-balance (e.g., jumping, diving, leaning, or falling).
- Guarding: A defender is guarding an offensive player when they are within three metres of that offensive player and are primarily focused on and reacting to that offensive player.
- Interception: When a player on the defensive team establishes possession of a throw by a player on the offensive team.
- Legitimate position The stationary or moving position established by a player that is not in breach of any rules.
- Line A boundary defining the playing areas. On an unlined field, the boundary is defined as an imaginary line between two field markers with the thickness of said markers. Line segments are not extrapolated beyond the defining markers.
- Making a play on the disc: When the disc is in the air and a player is attempting to make contact with the disc in any way e.g. to catch it or block it. This includes the process of running towards the place they expect to make contact with the disc.
- Marker: The defensive player who may call the stall count on the thrower.
- Minor: contact Contact that involves minimal physical force and does not alter the movements or position of another player. Contact with an opponent’s extended arms or hands that are about to, or already are, contacting the disc, or contact to the throwers hand during the throwing motion, is not considered to be minor contact.
- Non-player: Any person, including a team member, who is not currently a player.
- Offensive player: A player whose team is in possession of the disc.
- Out-of-bounds (OB): Everything that is not part of the playing field, including the perimeter lines.
- Perimeter lines Lines separating the central zone or end zone from the out-of-bounds area. They are not part of the playing field.
- Pivot: When the thrower moves in any direction while keeping one part of their body in constant contact with a specific point on the ground called the pivot point. A thrower establishes a pivot point by placing, or keeping, a particular part of their body at a specific point, which they intend to use as their pivot point. If a thrower has multiple options for a pivot point, the pivot point is not determined until they pivot.
- Pivot Location: The point on the playing field where the thrower is required to establish a pivot point after a turnover, after the pull, after a time-out, after leaving the central zone, or where a pivot point has already been established.
- Play: The time after the Pull has commenced and prior to the scoring of a goal. Play may further stop due to a call, in which case play is restarted with a check.
- Player: The people who are actually participating in the current point of play.
- Playing Field: The area including the central zone and the end zones, but excluding the perimeter lines.
- Possession of the disc: A player establishes possession of a pass when:
  1) they catch a pass and then they maintain that catch for more than one
  noticeable instant, and
  2) they maintain the catch throughout all ground contact related to the
  catch, or until they throw the disc.

  A player can also establish possession when a disc that has already hit the ground is picked up, or is given to them, after a turnover, pull, or stoppage. Once a player has established possession, they may change their grip on the disc and that does not affect their possession, as long as they maintain contact with the disc.
  A disc in the possession of a player, or caught by a player, is considered part of that player.
  The team whose player is in possession or whose players may pick up the disc is considered the team in possession.
- Pre-stall: A warning regarding time limits to resume play, issued by giving warnings at twenty (20), ten (10), and five (5) seconds (as applicable).
- Pull: The throw by the defence to the offence that starts play at the beginning of a half or after a goal. The pull is not considered a legal pass. Receivers All offensive players other than the thrower.
- Spirit Stoppage: A stoppage to discuss issues related to Spirit of the Game.
- Stoppage of play: Any halting of play due to a foul, violation, discussion, contested call, injury or time-out, that requires a check to restart play.
- Throw: A disc in flight following any throwing motion, including after a fake attempt and an intentionally dropped disc, that results in loss of contact between the thrower and the disc. A pass is the equivalent of a throw.
- Thrower: The offensive player in possession of the disc, or the player who has just thrown the disc prior to when the result of the throw has been determined.
- Throwing motion: The throwing motion is the motion that transfers momentum from the thrower to the disc in the direction of flight and results in a throw. Pivots and wind-ups are not part of the act of throwing.
- Turnover: Any event resulting in a change of the team in possession. A turnover is not considered a violation.
- Where the disc stops: Refers to the location where a player establishes possession, the disc comes to rest naturally, or where the disc is stopped from rolling or sliding.
